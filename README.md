## Using this repo

Each directory within the repo corresponds to one section of the course. You should fork the repo and follow along with the lessons and use/update/modify the code samples as needed.

There are a number of software tools used throughout the course. Instructions on the best way to set them up can be found in [03-installation-and-setup](03-installation-and-setup/README.md).

## Course Sections

### [01 - History and Motivation](01-history-and-motivation/README.md)
